    <h2 id="trader">Trader</h1>

    <p>Our daily work involves modifying and operating code to respond
    to changes in market conditions. Ongoing work involves performance
    tuning, algorithmic improvements and development of trading
    strategies. Candidates should be familiar with analyzing Haskell
    runtime performance, identifying compiler issues and writing
    efficient code. A background understanding of Linux systems
    programming and IP networking is desirable. We try to keep our
    office environment relaxed, but you should be comfortable working
    under pressure when the market demands it. </p>

    <p>There are a wide range of tools and applications that we want to
    build over time, including graphical interfaces and profiling tools
    for our trading system, parsers for new market feeds, and algorithms
    for trading strategies. If you have experience in any one of these
    areas it's a definite bonus.</p>

    <p>Ideally you can work well in a team environment, willing to
    mentor staff, able to assess and fix problems in high-pressure
    situations, and be able to work during market hours.</p>
    -->

    <h2 id="intern">Internship</h2>

    <p>Programmers have experience programming in a functional
    language, and are familiar with Haskell, systems programming, and
    web development, to join our global team. Experience with Linux/Unix
    system administration is preferred, and familiarity with Git is
    essential.</p>

    <p>The exact role is not fixed yet but we are looking for
    individuals that can assist our traders. We have several projects on
    the go at any given time, and we will expect that you can quickly
    adapt to any one of our problem domains.</p>

    <!--
    <h2 id="intern">Internship</h2>

    <p>See <a href="#programmer">programmer</a> description for more
    details.</p>

    <h2 id="devops">Haskell DevOps</h2>

    <p>We have some Ubuntu machines running our Haskell code, in production
    and simulation, distributed over three countries. We have developers
    hacking Haskell on git repos, and we ship a lot of data around
    internally. We need someone who groks our systems and tools to automate
    and simplify things as we grow our operations. Our ideal candidate will
    have experience in programming, building and tuning servers, networking
    and security, and data backup and redundancy.</p>

    <p>Since this position will involve programming and system
    development we ask that all candidates complete the code sample
    <a href="/en/code-sample.html"> here</a>. If you have any code
    snipplets or tools you have written, that you are especially proud
    of, please link to or attach them in your submission.</p>

    <p>Compensation is approximately $6,000 USD per month.</p>
